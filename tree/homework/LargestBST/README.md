## Largest BST
   
Given a binary tree, find the largest Binary Search Tree (BST), where largest means BST with largest number of nodes in it.  
The largest BST must include all of its descendants.
```
 
Example:

Input: [10,5,15,1,8,null,7]

   10 
   / \ 
  5  15 
 / \   \ 
1   8   7


Output: 3
Explanation: The Largest BST Subtree in this case is 1 <- 5 -> 8.
             The return value is the subtree's size, which is 3.

Can you figure out ways to solve it with O(n) time complexity?
