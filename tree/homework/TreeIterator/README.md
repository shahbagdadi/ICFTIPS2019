## Tree Iterator
   (Facebook Question)
   Implement an iterator over a binary search tree (BST). Your iterator will be initialized with the
   root node of a BST.
   1. Calling next() will return the next smallest number in the BST.
   2. Calling hasNext() should return whether the next element exists.
   Both functions should run in average O(1) time and uses O(h) memory, where h is the height
   of the tree.
   [Iterator is a concept in higher level languages like C++ or Java. You probably can
   tell what it is. If you want to know more, please feel free to Google for the concept.]
